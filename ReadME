Hi,

This is a website based on Asp.net and C#. This website is developed by using template.
To run this website, 
  First you need to change the path of database connection variable in "Web.Config" File,
   And After that go into "Blood Bank Management System\Blood Bank Management System\user" and run UserHome.aspx file to run this project.
   
   To run Admin Site you have to change url of browser to "admin/Admin_Login.aspx" and do not remove the localhost. 
        Eg.   http://localhost:4049/admin/Admin_Login.aspx
   Admin Id is "m@gmail.com" and Password is "M@123".
